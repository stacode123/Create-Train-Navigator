## üìö Dependencies
This mod requires the Minecraft [Create Mod v0.5.1e](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) or newer for [Minecraft Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net) or later. This mod also uses [DragonLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dragonlib), which is already embedded into the built jar, so you don't have to install it manually.

## ‚úÖ Features
This mod adds a new item, the Create Railways Navigator, which is inspired by the [DB Navigator](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB_Navigator) (an app in Germany where, among other things, you can get possible train connections). Like this app, the navigator in this mod is intended to suggest possible train connections for trains from the Create Mod in your Minecraft world. Various customization options allow you to specify which track stations should be treated as a single station and how your navigation results should be filtered and sorted so that you always receive the best possible route suggestions.
